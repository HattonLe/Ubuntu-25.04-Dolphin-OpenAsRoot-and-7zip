After hours of fiddling my brain hurtz - Open as Root working in Ubuntu using wayland.

How to get context menus for OpenAsRoot and 7Zip tools working in Dolphin file manager.

sudo apt-get install dolphin
sudo apt install konsole

NOTE The terminal used in dolphin is konsole.... its bell sound does not work out of the box, so configure it
   Using Dolphin open a konsole terminal window....
      Righthand edge, click the menu icon ... Settings... Configure_Notifications...
	    Bell in Non-Focused Session --> /usr/share/sounds/sound-icons/finish
	    Bell in Focused Session     --> /usr/share/sounds/sound-icons/finish
	
	  and click the "Play a sound" tickbox as well for both

To install these context menu action files...
   copy the "*.desktop" files into this folder --> "~/.local/share/kio/servicemenus/" (you may have to create that folder).

Relaunch dolphin afterwards and hopefully you can rightclick "Open as Root" which will prompt for password followed by it launching dolphin in root mode.
